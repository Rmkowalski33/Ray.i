# FTRV Order Allocation Adjustments
# ==================================
# Use this file to adjust how inventory needs are allocated across manufacturers.
# These adjustments override historical patterns based on your strategic direction.
#
# ADJUSTMENT TYPES:
# - manufacturer: Adjust a manufacturer's overall allocation
# - make: Adjust a specific make/brand line
# - segment: Adjust a vehicle type segment (TT, FW, MH, TH)
# - zone: Adjust allocation for a geographic zone
#
# ADJUSTMENT VALUES:
# - Use percentages: "+20%", "-30%", "+50%"
# - Positive = increase allocation, Negative = decrease
# - Adjustments are applied multiplicatively to the base allocation
#
# EXAMPLES:
# - "+20%" on JAYCO means if fair share was 100 units, it becomes 120
# - "-30%" on JAY FEATHER means if fair share was 50 units, it becomes 35
